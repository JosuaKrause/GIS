\section*{Soft Tasks}
\subsection*{Pub Crawl}
To investigate correlations in the OSM dataset, we provide a combined visualization
called \emph{Pub Crawl},
which shows the average minimum inter-pub distance and the average
minimum pub to ATM distance within each administrative area
(with more than one pub and at least one ATM). The dimensions were mapped to hue
and saturation, respectively, allowing us to visualize them both via polygon color (\figref{crawl}).
The two measures do not seem to be strongly correlated, but the visualization might
be useful for anyone planning to go bar-hopping in the capital.

\subsection*{Open Wi-Fi}

As additional dataset we use data of open and free Wi-Fi hotspots in
the area of Berlin.
The data is displayed as a heatmap.

The dataset originally consisted only of plain-text street addresses
of public institutions, hotels, bars, restaurants, coffee places, and other businesses with open Wi-Fi hotspots. We had used the Google geocoding API to retrieve street addresses for all buildings from the given dataset, based on the buildings' centroids. Wireless hotspots were then assigned to buildings by matching addresses between the two datasets.

The heatmap is computed in a mesh of
arbitrary size. Each cell is computed by adding
the nearest distances of all buildings with a Wi-Fi
hotspot together.
Since this is computationally expensive ($\mathcal{O}(whn)$ where $w$ and $h$
are the width and height of the mesh respectively and $n$ is the total number of lines
defining all buildings with Wi-Fi)
we start with a loose mesh and refine it up to one pixel per cell while the
user is inactive.

Looking at the heatmap reveals some areas with higher density of open hotspots.
Namely the center of the city (Mitte), around the Sony Center, in Prenzlauer Berg, and
in the area around Simon-Dach-Str. in Friedrichshain and around Kürfürstendamm in Wilmersdorf.
Those areas are known for being touristic and Mitte with Sony Center are additionally
areas with many businessmen.
As hotspots are likely to be in a restaurant, bar, or caf\'{e}
this seems to be due to the high demand for internet
of tourists (having no alternative) and businessmen (needing to
be online during lunch).

\label{fig:heat}
\end{figure}

Based on our visualization of the hotspot data, we hypothesized that the hotspot locations
are unevenly distributed, with a greater density near the city center.
To investigate this further, we computed a distribution of the hotspots w.r.t. their
distance from the centroid of Berlin and compared it to the distribution that would
result from a uniform hotspot density all over Berlin. Both distributions are visualized
as step functions in \figref{wifi_distributions}. Although this simple approach does
not permit conclusions regarding the significance of the apparent differences,
it does provide support for our hypothesis.
