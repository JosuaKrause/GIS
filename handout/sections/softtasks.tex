\subsection*{Open Wi-Fi}

As additional dataset we use data of open and free Wi-Fi hotspots in
the area of Berlin.
The data is displayed as heatmap.

The dataset originally consistet only of plain-text street addresses
of buildings with open Wi-Fi hotspots. We converted the
address data into building polygons via the Google Maps
API and the buildings from the OSM dataset.

The heatmap is computed in a mesh of
arbitrary size. Each cell is computed by adding
the nearest distances of all buildings with a Wi-Fi
hotspot together.
Since this is computationally expensive ($\mathcal{O}(whn)$ where $w$ and $h$
are the width and height of the mesh respectively and $n$ is the total number of lines
defining all buildings with Wi-Fi)
we start with a loose mesh and refine it up to one pixel per cell while the
user is inactive.
