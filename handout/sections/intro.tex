\section*{Introduction}
We present \emph{BeGIS}, a geographic information system
showcasing various presentation techniques exemplified with
data centered around the city Berlin.
The application uses a zoomable user-interface provided
by the cartography organization open-street maps and overlays
additional information on top of the map.
The real-world dataset is
attributed with geographic positions.
We show functionalities of our tool by solving tasks with the data.
The tasks are divided into hard and soft tasks.
Hard tasks show basic capabilities
of our tool and soft tasks allow for more freedom
and present extended functionality.
