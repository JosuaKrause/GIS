\section*{Introduction}
We present \todo{<NameHere>}, a geographic information system
showcasing various presentation techniques.
The application uses a zoomable user-interface provided
by the cartography organization open-street maps and overlays
additional information on top of the map.
We have a given real-world dataset centered around the city Berlin
attributed with position data and show the functionalities of
our tool by solving given tasks.

In the following we present the tasks which are divided into
hard and soft tasks. The hard tasks show basic capabilities
of our tool while the soft tasks allow for more freedom
and present extended functionality.
